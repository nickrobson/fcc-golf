# Code golfing [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com).
Golfing FCC questions to their shortest solutions.

## Rules:

- You must include `var` before undeclared variables (to prevent them from going to the global scope)
- Semicolons are always required where possible - even if they are optional according to ECMA.
- Do not use ECMA 7 or higher.
- Use single quotes for consistency
